# reCaptcha LWC Example

This [LWC](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/lwc) acts as a shell component to enable custom registration on an Experience Cloud site in Salesforce. The registration process leverages Google's reCaptcha to prevent bot signups. This sfdx project does not include the necessary Apex controller to create the contacts and user records in Salesforce, but demonstrates how protections can be included to prevent fraudulent signups. More information on configuring Experience Cloud for use with reCaptcha is available [here](https://www.learnexperiencecloud.com/article/Implementing-reCAPTCHA-in-Community-Cloud#LWCSupport).
